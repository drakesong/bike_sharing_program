# Bike Sharing Program (Linear Regression)

#### CS 347 Machine Learning Project 2
#### Drake Song
#### Fall Semester 2017, Professor Kathryn Leonard


###### Project description:
Using Linear Regression, convince the city of Los Angeles to implement a bike
sharing program.

###### How to run:
1. Required files:
    * backwardStepSel.m
    * calculateCI.m
    * checkCorrelation.m
    * compareRSquared.m
    * day.csv
    * project2.m
    <br><br>
2. Using MatLab, run *project2.m*

###### What to expect:
1. There will be comments displayed on the Command Window as the code runs
2. The following events will occur in order:
    * Check if there's any correlation between features
    * Calculate confidence intervals of each features
    * Utilize backwards step selection
    * Plot residuals
    * Calculate percentage of error for backwards step selection
    * Run lasso shrinkage model as alternative to backwards step selection
    * Calculate percentage of error for lasso shrinkage model
    * Use test data to determine efficiency of model
